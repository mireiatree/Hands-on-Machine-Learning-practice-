## Purpose
Strengthen machine learning knowledge through real coding exercises and applied theory.

## Overview
This repository contains my practical exercises while studying the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow".  
It includes foundational concepts and hands-on coding to better understand machine learning workflows.

## Topics Covered
- Supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., Clustering)
- Data preprocessing and pipelines
- Model evaluation and tuning
- Introduction to deep learning with TensorFlow (early chapters)
